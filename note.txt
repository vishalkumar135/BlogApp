There is an important difference between render and redirect_to: render will tell Rails what view it should use 
(with the same parameters you may have already sent) but redirect_to sends a new request to the browser.

When an action does not explicitly render a view (or otherwise trigger an HTTP response),
sRails will automatically render a view that matches the name of the controller and action. 

article.all  returns an ActiveRecord::Relation object, which you can think of as a super-powered array.


redirect_to will cause the browser to make a new request, whereas render renders the specified view for the current request.
 It is important to use redirect_to after mutating the database or application state. 
 Otherwise, if the user refreshes the page, the browser will make the same request, and the mutation will be repeated.


 The new action instantiates a new article, but does not save it. This article will be used in the view when building the form. 

 he full_messages_for method returns an array of user-friendly error messages for a specified attribute. If there are no errors for that attribute, the array will be empty.
